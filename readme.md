Here are all my repositories:
[Github/gorkempacaci](https://github.com/gorkempacaci)

(I had to make this a separate page as for some reason Google won't index my Github page.)

Here's some things I've been working on:

# [CombInduce](https://github.com/gorkempacaci/CombInduce)

This is the most recent synthesizer for Compositional Relational Programming (CNP) that has a multi-core algorithm. It's implemented in .Net 7 / C#

# [CNP Meta-interpreter](https://github.com/gorkempacaci/CNP)

This is the CNP interpreter implemented in Prolog. It doesn't contain the CNP synthesizer.

# [RICE & CNP Synthesizer](https://github.com/UppsalaIM/rice)

This packages the model prober we implemented in Python with a compatible CNP synthesizer used for the RICE workflow (See paper [Why did you do that?](http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1306760&dswid=-2562))

# [CNP embedding in Haskell](https://github.com/gorkempacaci/CNPHaskell)

This was an early experiment for a CNP embedding written in Haskell. It doesn't contain a parser, CNP constructs are implemented as functions, which is possible since the CNP language is syntactically functional, even though semantics are relational.
